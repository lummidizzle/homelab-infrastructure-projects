This folder contains automatically captured screenshots related to the Homelab Infrastructure Projects.

Each image here was renamed using a standardized naming convention (Auto_Screenshot_###.png) for clarity and sorting.

## File Naming Convention

All files follow the format:

    Auto_Screenshot_001.png
    Auto_Screenshot_002.png
    ...
    Auto_Screenshot_###.png

## Purpose

These screenshots visually document tasks, errors, fixes, logs, or configurations captured during system builds, hardening, automation, and daily operations. They are referenced across various parts of this repository.
