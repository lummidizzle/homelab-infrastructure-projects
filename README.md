About Me**

Hi there! Im Olumide  a passionate Linux Systems Engineer on a journey to build, break, and rebuild world-class infrastructure. I come from a non-traditional background, and after years of self-learning and homelab grinding, Ive earned RHCSA, RHCE, and Security+ certifications.

I specialize in Red Hat-based systems, configuration management with Ansible, system hardening (STIG), monitoring (Nagios), patching, and automation. My superpower? Turning bare-metal machines into enterprise-grade platforms using nothing but terminal magic, a lot of caffeine , and rock-solid shell scripts.

 **Current Projects**
- Comprehensive hybrid homelab (Windows Server 2022, RHEL 9/10, CentOS 9, Ubuntu Lite)
- Ansible automation for VM provisioning, user management, patching, and log cleanup
- GitHub-powered infrastructure documentation with scheduled syncs
- Centralized monitoring with Nagios and compliance auditing

 **What You'll Find in My Repos**
- Real-world homelab setups, fully documented and automated
- Scripts for optimizing Windows & Linux systems
- Infrastructure-as-Code examples using Ansible
- GitHub Actions for automation

 **Certifications**
- Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)
- Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)
- CompTIA Security+

 Fun Fact: I believe every Linux engineer should own a homelabits the gym where we train our skills.
