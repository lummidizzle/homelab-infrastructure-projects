# 🌐 Homelab Infrastructure Projects

Welcome to my evolving hybrid infrastructure lab!  
This GitHub Pages site documents real-world configurations, automations, and tools I'm using to build a **production-grade IT lab**.

🔧 Tools I'm working with:
- Red Hat / Ubuntu / CentOS
- Ansible Automation
- Nagios Monitoring
- GitHub Actions + Documentation
- Windows Server 2022
- Domain Controller / DNS / Active Directory

📁 Browse through the project structure in the repo to see:
- `/ansible/roles/` – Automation roles
- `/rhel9/` – RHEL server configurations
- `/windows/` – AD & Windows scripts
- `/scripts/` – Optimization & system cleanup tools

> This is a living project, constantly being updated and refined.
