## About Me

Hi there! I’m Olumide — a passionate Linux Systems Engineer on a journey to build, break, and rebuild world-class infrastructure.

I come from a non-traditional background, and after years of self-learning and homelab grinding, I've earned **RHCSA**, **RHCE**, and **Security+** certifications.

I specialize in:
- Red Hat-based systems
- Configuration management with **Ansible**
- System hardening (**STIG**)
- Monitoring (**Nagios**)
- Patching and automation

🧙‍♂️ My superpower? Turning bare-metal machines into enterprise-grade platforms using terminal magic, gallons of coffee, and rock-solid shell scripts.

💬 _Fun Fact_: I believe every Linux engineer should own a homelab — it’s the gym where we train our skills.
