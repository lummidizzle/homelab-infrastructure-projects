Small utility scripts used across the homelab:

- `cleanup-repo.sh` – safely cleans DNF/YUM caches/metadata + old temp dirs.
- `check-service-status.sh` – quick health for services, timers, and 8080/tcp.
- `gather-system-info.py` – prints a compact diagnostic block for tickets.

> Tip: run from anywhere, they’re self-contained. Consider adding this dir to PATH.
