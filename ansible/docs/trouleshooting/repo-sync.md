# Homelab Repo Server Sync â€“ Three Days of Pain, Growth & Automation (2025-08-06 â†’ 2025-08-08)

## **Context**
The goal of this phase was to:
1. Set up a **central repo server** (`reposync.corp.local`) that syncs package repositories to a mounted storage location on **HP2**.
2. Automate the sync process with a **bash script** and cron jobs.
3. Ensure **RHEL and Ubuntu servers** can pull updates from this repo.
4. Integrate automation via **Ansible playbooks** for Ubuntu update scheduling.
