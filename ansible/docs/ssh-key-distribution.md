# ✨ Ansible Documentation Index - Homelab Infrastructure Projects

Welcome to the documentation hub for all Ansible automation implemented in the **Homelab Infrastructure Projects** repository. This is your spellbook, your journal, and your battle-tested memory bank of everything we’ve built, broken, and fixed again.

## 🔧 Core Configuration Topics

Each of the following entries will walk through the full process (manual + automated) of that specific Ansible task:

* [SSH Key Distribution](./ssh-key-distribution.md)
* [Sudoers Configuration](./sudoers-configuration.md)
* [Static Inventory File](./static-inventory.md)
* [Jinja2 Hosts File Templating](./jinja2-hosts-template.md)
* [Ansible CFG Configuration](./ansible-cfg-control-node.md)
* [Local Repo Setup](./local-repo-setup.md)
* [SELinux & Firewall Troubleshooting](./selinux-troubleshooting.md)

---

## ✅ Purpose

This documentation aims to:

* Make the automation process repeatable and scalable
* Track exactly what was done, why, and how
* Capture errors and workarounds
* Make onboarding and revisiting easier

## ⏱ Weekly Automation

This folder is set to auto-update via a scheduled script that commits and pushes changes every Friday at 5 PM. Logs will be stored and pushed to GitHub.

## ✍ Notes

> If it ain’t documented, it didn’t happen. If it ain’t version-controlled, you didn’t do it.

Everything here is handcrafted by Olumide with ❤️, caffeine, and a few curse words directed at `SELinux`.

## ✨ Quote of the Day

> "Automation is to sysadmins what spellbooks are to wizards." ⚔️

Let’s go write `ssh-key-distribution.md` next!
