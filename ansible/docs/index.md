# Ansible Documentation Hub (Homelab Infrastructure Project)

Welcome to the centralized documentation hub for the `homelab-infrastructure-projects` Ansible configuration. This directory is where **all** role-specific and project-wide documentation lives for future reference, reproducibility, and collaboration.

---

## ðŸ“œ Documentation Structure

Each major Ansible role or component in our infrastructure has its own subdirectory and a detailed `README.md` file. Use this index to quickly navigate to any part of the configuration and see what was done, why it was done, and how to replicate it.

## ðŸ›  Automated Patching (RHEL/Rocky + Controller)

We standardized patching across the environment to align with conventional IT standards for reliability, security, and compliance.

- **Patch Frequency:**
  - **Weekly Security Patching:** Every Saturday at 02:00 AM (low activity window).
  - **Monthly Full Patching:** First Saturday of each month at 02:00 AM.
- **Verification:**
  - Patches verified via `dnf check-update` and post-patch `dnf history`.
  - Controller runs `ansible-playbook patch.yml --check` (dry run) midweek before production patching.
- **Rollback:**
  - Last 2 kernel versions retained for emergency boot.
  - `dnf history rollback` documented in `patching/README.md`.
- **Scope:**
  - Applies to all RHEL/Rocky servers and the Ansible controller itself.
  - Ubuntu/Debian systems follow a parallel process documented in `patching/README.md`.
- **Documentation:**
  - Detailed runbook: [patching/README.md](patching/README.md)
  - Error tracking: [error-log.md](error-log.md)

## ðŸ—º How to Use This Hub

- Each role has its **own folder** under `ansible/roles/` and an associated **docs folder** under `ansible/docs/`.
- All changes made via Ansible should be reflected in both code and documentation.
- When updating or creating a new role, remember to:
  1. Add/update the corresponding `README.md`.
  2. List it here in the table with a link.
  3. Commit the changes to GitHub.
