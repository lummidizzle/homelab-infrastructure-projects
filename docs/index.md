# 🗂 Documentation Hub

Welcome to the documentation section of my homelab infrastructure project.

This space will eventually include:

- 📘 Step-by-step server setup guides
- 🧱 Role-by-role breakdowns (Ansible, monitoring, backups)
- 🚨 Troubleshooting logs (the good, the bad, and the “why is this even broken?”)
- 📝 Weekly change logs and GitHub update notes

> Whether you're a recruiter, fellow sysadmin, or my future self — this is where the inner workings of the lab live.
